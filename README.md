# Cordic Trigonometric Generator

This repository provides a robust implementation of a **CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer)**-based trigonometric generator. The project includes Python utilities for generating fixed-point C implementations of sine and cosine functions, along with C++ unit tests to validate the generated code. 

## Features

- **CORDIC Algorithm:** Efficient, hardware-friendly calculation of sine and cosine values.
- **Python Generator:** Generates fixed-point C implementations.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive tests for Python generator and generated C code using `pytest` and `CppUTest`.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Compatible with Linux and WSL2 environments.
